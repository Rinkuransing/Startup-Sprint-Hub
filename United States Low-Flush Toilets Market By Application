Low-flush toilets are increasingly being adopted in homes due to their water-saving features and environmental benefits. These toilets, often equipped with dual-flush systems, provide homeowners with the flexibility to choose the appropriate flush volume for liquid or solid waste, thereby conserving water and reducing utility bills. With rising awareness about sustainability and water conservation, many homeowners are opting for low-flush toilets as a means to contribute to environmental protection while maintaining high standards of hygiene and comfort. As residential properties increasingly incorporate green building practices and eco-friendly technologies, the demand for low-flush toilets continues to grow.
